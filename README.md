# Evolving Demographics: South Africa
This project analyzes and visualizes the trends in South Africa's female population over the years 1960 to 2023. Using visual tools such as histograms and line plots, it explores how the female demographic has evolved, offering insights into growth patterns and changes over time. The project uses publicly available data to create easy-to-understand visualizations, enabling data-driven storytelling about South Africa's demographic shifts.

### Target Audience:
Policy Makers: To support informed decisions in gender-specific policy development.
Researchers & Demographers: To aid in studies of population dynamics and socio-economic trends.
Educators & Students: As a resource for learning about population trends and data visualization techniques.
General Public: To promote awareness and understanding of demographic changes in South Africa.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in exploring population data, gaining insights into demographic trends, or learning how to use visualization to tell meaningful data stories.
